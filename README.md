# Landmark Papers in AI and Machine Learning

This repository contains papers on Machine Learning and AI which developed important techniques. It is not a exaustive guide, just a space where I share papers that I think are significant.

#### Information Retrieval

##### TF-IDF

TF-IDF is used for keyword-based search in document collections, such as in basic search engines or in information filtering tasks. It is simple, fast, and effective for keyword-based tasks but	no semantic understanding, limited term frequency handling.

##### BM25

Widely used in modern search engines and information retrieval systems where document length and query term frequency normalization are important.

##### BM25+

An enhanced version of BM25 that corrects some of its biases, particularly regarding document length.

##### Language Models for Information Retrieval (LMIR)

Language models are used in more advanced search engines where the goal is to calculate the probability of a query being generated from a documentâ€™s "language model.

##### Vector Space Model (VSM)

Useful for information retrieval tasks where documents and queries can be represented as vectors in a multi-dimensional space (like document classification and clustering).
