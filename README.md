##### [Natural Language Processing](#natural-language-processing)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, allowing for tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and text summarization. NLP combines linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data, enabling computers to handle tasks like understanding context, meaning, and intent in text or speech.

**Key Topics:**
- Text Preprocessing and Tokenization
- Embedding and Representation Techniques
    - Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, Transformers
    - Language Modeling
    - RNNs for Language Modeling, Transformer Models (BERT, GPT)
    - Text Classification and Sequence Modeling
    - Applications in Sentiment Analysis, Chatbots, Translation
 
#### [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](#retrieval-augmented-generation)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced approach in artificial intelligence that combines information retrieval with language generation to enhance the performance of language models. In a RAG system, when a model is tasked with generating an answer or text, it first retrieves relevant information from a large database or knowledge base, such as a document corpus or vector store, which it uses as additional context. This combination allows the model to provide more accurate, specific, and contextually rich responses than it could generate alone, making it particularly useful for tasks like question answering, summarization, and conversational AI. RAG leverages both machine learning for retrieving information and deep learning for language generation, creating a hybrid system that can efficiently utilize external knowledge to improve response quality.
